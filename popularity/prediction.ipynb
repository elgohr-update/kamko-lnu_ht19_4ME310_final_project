       "'     (Natural News)  What follows in this article is a thought experiment. Many believe the phenomena described here to be real. What do you believe? —- Begin thought experiment —- Markus Persson, the creator of Minecraft, just pointed out that the political Left has “literally been taken over by evil.” (Source) It turns out he’s more correct than even he might realize. Over the last several years, Leftists have morphed into an irrational, hate-filled violent mob of “Demoncrats” that don’t even resemble conscious human beings. Operating like a zombie swarm of mindless lunatics, they are now taking over entire cities like Portland, Oregon, where even the local police now stand down and allow deranged Left-wing mobs to run the city. Watch this astonishing video where an elderly white man is being harassed, racially verbally assaulted and then has his vehicle windows smashed by deranged left-wing lunatics who have taken over the city of Portland, apparently with the full permission of the snowflake mayor and the pathetic, spineless Portland Police:  Note that this incident took place just one block from a Portland Police station, where there wasn’t a single police officer who took action against these Democrat thugs who are now taking over city streets and screaming racial slurs at white people. (All in the name of “social justice,” of course.) This isn’t the first case of a major U.S. city falling to the anarchy of left-wing lunatics. As the Wall Street Journal reports about another Portland incident from June: A mob surrounded ICE’s office in Southwest Portland June 19. They barricaded the exits and blocked the driveway. They sent “guards” to patrol the doors, trapping workers inside. At night they laid on the street, stopping traffic at a critical junction near a hospital. Police stayed away. “At this time I am denying your request for additional resources,” the Portland Police Bureau’s deputy chief, Robert Day, wrote to federal officers pleading for help. Hours later, the remaining ICE workers were finally evacuated by a small federal police team. The facility shut down for more than a week. An epidemic of hatred, mindlessness and anarchy is sweeping across Leftist populations A reasonable person might describe this sweeping expansion of hatred and anarchy as an “epidemic.” But there’s no virus that can explain the phenomenon. The cause isn’t viral or bacterial, it turns it: It’s spiritual. Many people believe that Leftists are literally being possessed by demonic forces that they’ve invited into their lives through the mechanisms described below. This could explain the hatred, the mindlessness, the desire for killing their opponents and their complete lack of anything resembling rationality or logic. Today’s typical left-wing lunatic cannot explain anything they believe. Instead, they resort to screaming, accusing, kicking and crying. These are all expressions of lunacy, not rationality or reason. Take a look at some of the lunacy of Leftists in this astonishing video:  Importantly, recognize that these are not the actions of conscious human beings. That’s because these Leftists are no longer human, the theory goes. Demonic possession is real... and it’s spreading Demonic possession is a real phenomenon. Catholic priests are being recruited in record numbers to battle actual demons who are seizing control of human minds and bodies. “The diocese of Milan recently nominated seven new exorcists, the bishop of Naples appointed three new ones a couple of years ago and the Catholic Church in Sardinia sent three priests for exorcism training in Rome,” reports The Telegraph (UK). “In Spain, Antonio Maria Rouco Varela, the archbishop of Madrid, chose eight priests to undergo special training in May to confront what he described as ‘an unprecedented rise’ in cases of ‘demonic possession’. The Church in Spain was coming across many cases that ‘go beyond the competence of psychologists’ and they were occurring with ‘a striking frequency’, the archbishop said.” The Catholic Church’s top exorcist, Father Gabriele Amorth, says he has personally “sent 160,000 demons back to hell,” reports the Christian Post. As the story reports: An 84-page update of exorcism rites compiled in 1614 and drawn up in 1998 stipulates how Catholic priests trained as exorcists should operate. According to the guidelines established by the church, they have to follow a ritual known as “De exorcismis et supplicationibus quibusdam,” or “Of exorcisms and certain supplications.” All across the planet, priests are being tasked with an increasing number of demonic possessions, which they describe as a demon entity entering the body of a human being through a spiritual portal or opening. But what’s causing these openings that demonic entities can use to possess human beings? Abortion is a child sacrifice ritual that opens the spirit to demonic possession Catholic priests have all sorts of theories about how demon spirits possess human beings. Amorth, for example, believes that reading Harry Potter books opens young minds to demonic possession. Some priests believe that practicing yoga causes a person to turn to Satan, but they’ve all somehow missed the obvious: Pope Francis himself has been possessed by demonic forces and is working on Earth as an “ambassador” to Satan. The Catholic Church, it turns out, is run by Satan from the very top. Throughout the history of human civilizations, the phenomenon of opening the human spirit to demonic possession — a kind of spiritual portal — has been “powered” by child sacrifice. In ancient Aztec and Mayan civilizations, human children were routinely murdered to appease what local priests believed to be spiritual gods. The act of murdering children en masse — some ancient rituals involving the marathon murder of as many as 80,000 children and adults in a single setting — serves as a powerful “magnet” to attract evil. When people murder children to invoke power, they invite evil, demonic forces to possess their minds and bodies. This is the abortion industry in America: A child sacrifice factory that mirrors the mass murder rituals of ancient human civilizations. Today, Leftists worship the murder of children and celebrate abortions as a sign of being “progressive.” Disguised as “reproductive health,” the abortion industry in America today is actually a child sacrifice factory that serves to keep open the portals of spiritual possession, allowing demonic forces to seize control of human minds. Those who worship abortion also worship Satan and death. The recent fight over Brett Kavanaugh was, to many Leftists, a fight to maintain their child sacrifice abortion factories, because without all the negative energy of fear and terror generated by abortion factories, the political Left would not have sufficient dark spiritual energy to power its demons that feed on such negative emotions. Once controlled by demonic possession, once-human individuals are no longer humans. They are demon-possessed activists for evil who pretend to be human. They still inhabit human bodies and have access to all the memories and knowledge of the original host they have now possessed, the thinking goes. This is why they can be easily mistaken for human beings when they’re actually demons in human form. If you follow this line of thinking, it’s not difficult to conclude that nearly all the top Leftists are actually former humans who have become possessed by demon spirits. Many of these people are then elevated to top positions in comedy, culture, music and especially Hollywood, where overt worship of Satan has become a routine ritual among the rich and famous. Some of the most powerful demons-in-human-form are promoted to become U.S. Senators. Over time, the inner demon begins to overtake the human form, leading to aged humans who literally resemble demonic creatures. For example, take a look at this actual photo of California Sen. Dianne Feinstein:  Or look at the hollow, dark, soulless eyes of George Soros, who funds the operations of left-wing evil all across our planet. It’s like peering into the empty soul of Satan himself:  Demon possession now defines Democrats and the DNC, whose members engage in “spirit cooking” rituals to strengthen their demonic power According to emails released by Wikileaks, many of the top people at the DNC are followers of “spirit cooking,” a bizarre, demon-worshiping ritual in which participants consume human menstrual blood, semen and breast milk. As InfoWars reported in 2016: In what is undoubtedly the most bizarre Wikileaks revelation to date, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was invited to a “spirit cooking dinner” by performance artist Marina Abramovic, to take part in an occult ritual founded by Satanist Aleister Crowley. Spirit cooking refers to “a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley” and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”. See this “spirit cooking” video posted on Brighteon.com: (WARNING: Graphic images)  Similarly, many people have observed that Hillary Clinton appears to be either suffering from a bizarre neurological disorder or something resembling demonic possession. Watch this remix video of Hillary Clinton laughing hysterically about murdering her political enemies, braking like a dog and behaving like a complete lunatic, and then demanding that Americans vote for her merely because she has a vagina:  Hillary Clinton, of course, is also a “serial murderer,” explains this Brighteon.com episode from Truth Matters:  The LGBT movement is a demonic war on the continuation of the human species One of the most sinister expressions of demonic influence and demon possession of former human beings is the rise of the LGBT agenda which seeks the destruction of male-female families and human reproduction. The LGBT movement has now descended into absolute lunacy, claiming that men and women are exactly the same, meaning that reproductive organs do not exist and that biological reproduction therefore isn’t real. They quite literally insist that children are “born genderless” (without reproductive organs) and are spontaneously “assigned a gender” at birth, which causes genitals to magically appear. But those genitals are meaningless, according to LGBT demons, because they claim that men can get pregnant, women can become men and that men can become women through magical invocations. This utterly insane narrative — which contradicts biological reality — is now being embraced by children’s hospitals, where gender designations are being removed from medical bracelets in the name of LGBT progressivism. This medical insanity, of course, will negatively impact the efforts of doctors to treat the health conditions of those children, given that male and female humans are obviously different in their medical challenges and needs. But the LGBT community wants doctors to pretend that there’s no such thing as a male or female child, and that all children are “created equal.” Thus, LGBT lunatics want doctors to treat male babies and female babies as being exactly the same, even if the medical concerns involve hormones or reproductive organs. Some men who are part of the insane LGBT movement actually visit OB/GYN doctors and demand pap smears. This is the lunacy that has now taken over the deranged Left. LGBT agendas are an assault on the reproductive continuity of the human race Ultimately, this is all an assault on the continuity of the human race which can only be maintained through sexual reproduction involving a male and a female. The demonic Left is attempting to obliterate all normal sexual reproduction by painting homosexual partnership as the new normal, which just happens to coincide with a complete inability to reproduce the human species. (Two men cannot make a baby. Nor can two women, no matter what the deranged, lunatic libtards claim.) Across all popular culture, including Netflix movies, Amazon Prime programming, Hollywood films, TV shows and music, heterosexual relationships are being demonized and marginalized, while homosexual pairing — and “gender-fluidity” — are celebrated and promoted. This goes way beyond merely respecting the personal choice and individual liberty of people who choose to live with same-sex partners. The promotion of all this is now targeting children as a form of cultural indoctrination. The upshot is that if an entire generation of children can be brainwashed into choosing same-sex partners, the human race will cease to reproduce after just one generation. Since one of the key goals of Satan is the complete destruction of humanity, this outcome would neatly achieve precisely that goal. Transgenderism and the denial of biological gender is also an assault on the very definition of men and women being “made in God’s image,” as the Christian faith explains. Make no mistake: The LGBT indoctrination of children — and the celebration of transgender children — is pure evil. It is not merely a crime against those children; it is part of a spiritual assault on humanity and the attempted extermination of the human race which can only be sustained through sexual reproduction between a man and a woman. (By the way, merely stating this obvious point is now considered “hate speech” by the demonic Left, which censors every thought or element of speech that does not further their agenda of the complete destruction of all human life.) “Climate change” narrative is a war on LIFE on Earth The demonic, destructive, anti-life forces of the Left have also declared war on all life on Earth through the advancement of their “climate change” narrative. This dangerous, anti-science narrative demands the complete elimination of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — an act that would collapse all plant and animal life on the planet, given that virtually all plants need CO2 to survive. The global warming narrative calls for a cold, dead ice planet where no liquid water flows because it’s all locked up in frozen ice caps. That’s what the Demoncrats demand: A frozen ice planet, devoid of life, with no CO2 available for plants to use for photosynthesis. They actually describe their efforts as a “war on carbon,” apparently oblivious to the reality that humans are carbon-based lifeforms. Any war on carbon is a war on humanity, which is exactly what the Demoncrats are carrying out. CO2 levels are already dangerously low across our planet. A world with higher CO2 would support more life, not less. Higher CO2 levels would unleash more diverse rainforests, lush plant life and abundant animal life across the planet, transforming deserts into forests thanks to the unlocking of frozen water and higher levels of rainfall for inland regions. But this “greening” of the planet is precisely what Demoncrats are hoping to halt... because they are enemies of life and enemies of ecological sustainability. They seek the absolute destruction of all life on planet Earth, almost as if they were trying to pull off some sort of terraforming agenda to kill off humans and render the planet dead. The entirety of mainstream “science” — if you can even call it that — is now dedicated to this mission of destroying the Earth’s atmospheric chemistry by eliminating all CO2 and driving both plants and animals to extinction. It’s all being carried out, of course, in the name of “sustainability.” The Devil can’t stop laughing at how easily left-wing humans are brainwashed into believing their their own global suicide us part of “sustainability.” We are not in a political war; we are in a spiritual war The mistake people make today is thinking that Democrats are merely human beings with different political views. In truth, they no longer possess human consciousness at all. They are possessed by demonic forces that seek the total destruction of life, liberty and humanity. This is why they are obsessed with abortion murder, economic destruction, media lies and the complete obliteration of the family consisting of a man and a woman who can reproduce to perpetuate the human species. Leftists seek the complete annihilation of sustainable life on Earth. They are actively working to eliminate CO2 from the atmosphere and collapse the entire global food web, and they’re deliberately spreading mass infertility through WHO-demanded vaccine interventions that have been repeatedly proven to administer infertility chemicals to vaccine recipients. As I explain in detail in this eye-opening video, if the Left wins, humanity DIES.  How to defeat the demonic forces of Leftism and literally save humanity from annihilation Step 1: Wake up and realize they are not human. They are demon spirits which have possessed human minds and bodies, rendering them into demonic entities rather than conscious human beings. This is why they behave as evil, deranged, violent lunatics complete devoid of logic, reason or human decency. Step 2: Realize this is not a political war but a spiritual war. The demon-possessed Leftists don’t merely want to achieve political victory and rule society with “progressive” ideas; they seek to destroy humanity, obliterate human life, mass murder babies, outlaw Christianity, demonize people based on the color of their skin, and even decimate all crops, forests and food sources on the planet by eliminating CO2 from the atmosphere. They are at war with humanity, and they merely pretend to be interested in politics as a means to accomplish their complete destruction of life on Earth. Step 3: Defeat the demons. Humanity must come to its senses and use every available means to rid the world of demonic entities. Defeating Demoncrats at the ballot box isn’t nearly enough (although it’s a start). In many films and books, “demon hunters” are dispatched to drive evil from this Earth. In the film “Constantine,” starring Keanu Reeves, protectors of humanity use exotic weapons to drive demons out of human bodies, sending them back to hell. Countless other films depict similar defenses of Earth against demonic forces, including the Avengers, which depicts a large portal opening in the sky, through which evil demons rush in from another dimension to annihilate humanity.  Although such films are dramatizations, they are not pure fiction. They depict phenomena that many people believe to be entirely real and happening right now. For example, many people believe that CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, is a high-energy portal to another dimension from which demonic forces are summoned into our plane of existence. Both the CERN logo and the logo for Google Chrome — built by one of the most demonic, evil tech companies in existence — overlay “666” in concentric circles, indicating their worship of Satan and the destruction of humanity:  Further supporting the theory, the CERN facility features a statue of Shiva, the Hindu Goddess known as “the Destroyer” of worlds.  CERN’s connections to the occult are widely discussed across the internet, with some people believing that the bizarre occult rituals that are routinely performed in front of CERN involve “mock human sacrifice” and other forms of Satan worship which scientists describe as a “prank” in order to distract from the fact that they are nonetheless carrying out the ritual:  An epic battle of good vs. evil Look at Google today, which best represents the Democrats and their cheating, lying, censoring and oppression of truth. Google is run by Democrats who absolutely despise America, hate Christian white men and who literally seek the destruction of all knowledge they cannot control. (This all came out in a bombshell internal Google report that was recently leaked to Breitbart News.) After banning Natural News, InfoWars and thousands of other liberty-oriented websites and video channels, Google now claims it’s a “conspiracy theory” to believe they exert any bias at all. Google is saturated with evil, which is exactly what enables the discredited technology company to build suppression and surveillance systems for evil communist regimes like Red China, where religion is criminalized by the evil government regime that Google serves. These actions on the part of Google have recently led to Google engineers to flee the company to escape the intense evil that’s present there. To save humanity, we must defeat not merely Google but all forms of evil that now dominate our society. In addition to Google, we must also defeat and dismantle the DNC, the CDC, the FDA and the entire left-wing media complex that brainwashes humanity into a suicide cult (through planned disinformation, the embracing of suicidal technologies like 5G, the promotion of life-damaging herbicides, and so on). Recognize that the Left is not a political movement but an eradication army that is systematically working to destroy humanity and transform the planet into a cold, lifeless dead zone. They cannot be reasoned with or educated with rational ideas. They are immune to reason because they aren’t humans on the inside. They must be defeated at every level of society in order to rid our world of demonic evil. —- End thought experiment —- Or maybe they’re all just really stupid morons who aren’t possessed by demons but are somehow incredibly stupid humans, in which case we need to defeat them anyway.
